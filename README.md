# Beltway Dragon

Beltway Dragon is a WordPress theme for a simple blog.
The theme only uses two WordPress pages; there is a home page
with paginated blog posts and a single post page that displays
the post, the comments and a comment form.

If you want to see what the theme looks like, I use the theme
for my WordPress programming blog here:

# Installation

If you want to use this theme, then drop all the files here
